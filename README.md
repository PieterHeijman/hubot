Lets your bot roll dice for you. It uses the notation system used in Dungeons and Dragons. So rolling 1 six-sided die is written as *1d6*. Simply ask "roll [die type]", or "roll a [die type]".

**example**:

roll 2d8

This will result in 2 eight-sided dice being rolled.

roll a d20

This will result in 1 twenty-sided die being rolled
